            <h1>Ben, a Veteran Interpreter and Translator</h1>
            <p>
                I've been a professional interpreter and translaor for more than five years,
                helping many in bridging the language barrier. I would like to share a bit 
                about my experience and what I've learned.

                    <h1>How I Started</h1>
                    <p>
                        The beginnings of my career as a professional interpreter and translator 
                        was not something I entirely expected, but in hindsight, it was something 
                        that I grew into.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I was still in school, I oftentimes found myself helping family and
                        friends who had trouble communicating in English, well, communicate with 
                        English. Someone being able to receive help in overcoming the language 
                        barrier is a given. Essential even. If I could be the one to do it, then
                        of course I would.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether it was translating documents into written Chinese or relaying 
                        the contents of phone calls back into Cantonese or Mandarin, I continued 
                        to help without considering what I provided was a service. Something 
                        valuable. A skill that many would need. and maybe aren't fortunate enough 
                        to know someone who can help, or be at a position where help was readily 
                        available.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So with the skills I gained by just being myself and helping others, there came
                        a time when I had a thought. Maybe I could apply my abilities even further, put
                        them to even better use. Maybe, there was something more that I could do. With 
                        that, I decided to try my hand at being a professional, and join in others in 
                        providing a service that could help many more.
